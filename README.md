# terms
 * immutable - In Rust, variables are immutable by default, which means that their values cannot be changed. If a new value is assigned to a variable that was declared with the let keyword, the program wonâ€™t compile.
 * mutable - When a variable does need to change its value during run-time, the mut keyword can be used to indicate that the variable is mutable.
 * block - a set of brackets {...}, blocks can be inside other blocks {..{...}..}
